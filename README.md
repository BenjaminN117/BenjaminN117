## Hey! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile. 


My name is Benjamin Norman. I am currently a 3rd year student at the University of Suffolk reading BSc Cyber Security. I have a passion for challenging projects ranging from cloud computing computing to embedded systems. This curiosity expands to the security aspect of computer science where my focus is aimed at engineering the best solution that adhears to best practices. In addition to this I am strongly familier with using pen testing tools such as Nmap and Metasploit framework.
